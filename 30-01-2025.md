I created my about me page tryed to do it
all from  memory ventured over to the javascript
side forgot a lot of things how ever if I looked up
the codes it will all come back to me.

had some help from Josh about git hub I didn't have 
the github desktop version.

group reading session about atomic habits was good.

feeling alot better getting use to the computer.
