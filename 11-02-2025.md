Today I recapped on grid and flexbox
I watched a couple of videos on those subjects
I tried putting my code from frontend challenges into the grid format 
didn't go to well because my css was all over the place 
so I will start again from scratch using grid.
over all it was a nice day.
a big improvement with navagating around the computer feeling a lot
more confident.
my challenges today were transferring code into the grid 
I have a better understanding on how to do that.
I will try uploading this document via vs code
Thank you
