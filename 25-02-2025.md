Today was a great Day I completed 3 front end challenges
using the :root for var colors etc 
finally got the google fonts on lock .
I was experimentiing trying different ways with the width
% px and not having a width. I am also trying not to use 
p tags heading tags instead just divs for one of my front end projects
today went smooth no blockers.
Josh did a little demo I picked a couple of useful tips with the flex grow
Thankyou
