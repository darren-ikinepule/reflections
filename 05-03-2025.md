Completed my javasript week seven I really
enjoyed the challenges this time round
I actually understood what I was doing surprisnly.
still a long way to go but now theres more clarity.
had a zoom session with Jen about atomic habbits.
Change my enviourment so im more likely to do
my new habit. eg I put my shoes , socks, shorts, singlet
on my couch. If i see them there  im more likely to
go for a run.
awsome day.
