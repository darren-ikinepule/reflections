I started the front end mentor challanges 
I had trouble down loading the fonts from google because I havent done 
that before.
Josh assited me also explained the linking of my css through the href="";
still learning to navigate my way around with the web but each day getting
better. I havent grasp the git hub yet still need work there.
once I start coding Im okay its just the start up side of things.
Overall I enjoyed myself learnt a couple of new things today. Thank you
