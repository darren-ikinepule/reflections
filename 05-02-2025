I'm feeling more comfortable being on the computer
finding it a little easier navagating around with slack and git hub.
I am doing a front end developement challenge completed 95% of it all ready in 2 days
just have to put it together now because I was doing it section by section.
A great talk from Mr Karl former boss of Data Com took away some good insights Sigmore Curves
keeping your self at a constant learning dont get stale becaause changes happen fast in the tech industry
be prepared to do something completed different.
Thank you a good day!!
