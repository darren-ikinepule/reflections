frustrating been trying to log in to computer

I already log on to another computer

all ready 
sitting here for over an hour cant even
log in . self doubt creeping in just remind
myself its only first day back.
feels good to be back coding im alot more relaxed than the first time
i felt abit lost didnt know what i should be doing but im happy to say that has changed.
