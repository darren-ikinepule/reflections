Today was our weekly review on flex box
I realise when it comes to time restraints I tend to make silly 
mistakes then get flustered. I knew how to make my code shorter and flex-box
is quite easy for me but the time count down makes me panic I have to settle myself down
read the instructons properly and just code. after the actual test I see exactly 
what I should of done and how i could of completed it better.
If there wasnt a count down I could of finished it way faster then the required time
funny that.
