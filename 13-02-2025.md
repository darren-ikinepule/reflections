This morning we had a guest speaker Sasha from
money sweet spot. I enjoyed that.
I had a review challenge about a pizza website I didnt do
to well I was taking my time thinking it was too easy then when it was 5 mins to 
go I started rushing it making a few mistakes along the way. 
Im better than that I didnt read the md file properly because I was rushing next
time I will do better.
I didnt complete the challenge pretty enbarrasing.
I also did a survey challenge for josh I found that quite challenging 
the questions were quite difficult I didnt understand most of them.
I learn't how to put the emoji codes into html also the unicode into the Head Meta area.
another Awesome day.
Thankyou
